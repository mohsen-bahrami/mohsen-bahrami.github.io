                            <p id="abstractText1" style="display: none;">Small and Medium-sized Enterprises play a significant role in most economies by contributing to job creation and economic growth. A majority of such merchants rely on business financing, and thus, financial institutions and investors need to assess their performance before making decisions on business loans. However, current methods of predicting merchants’ future performance involve their private internal information, such as revenue and customer base, which cannot be shared without potentially exposing critical information. To address this problem, we first propose a novel approach to predicting merchants’ future performance using credit card transaction data. Specifically, we construct a merchant network, regarding customers as bridges between merchants, and extract features from the constructed network structure for prediction purposes. Our study results demonstrate that the performance of machine learning models with features extracted from our proposed network is comparable to those with conventional revenue- and customer-based features, while maintaining higher privacy levels when shared with third-party organizations. Our approach offers a practical solution to privacy concerns over data and information required for merchants’ performance prediction, enabling safe data-sharing among financial institutions and investors, helping them make more informed decisions on allocating their financial resources while ensuring that merchants’ sensitive information is kept confidential.

To make such predictions, sales time series or final customers’ data in geographical disaggregation are necessary. However, for most companies, such datasets are unavailable or impractical. The manuscript has two main goals. One focal problem is how to disaggregate an aggregate sales prediction with no historical proportions. The other is how to improve spatial models using Point of Interest (POI) data. To solve these problems, we combine two literature streams — spatial marketing and sales forecasting — and propose a new hybrid probabilistic approach: Gravitational Sales Prediction (GSP). Our approach uses POI data to estimate area attraction, customer stocks, and flows to predict sales proportions. We later use these proportions to disaggregate an aggregate forecast. GSP is validated using sales data from two countries and more than ten economic segments. When compared to a strong benchmark that relies on past sales proportions, GSP exceeded expectations by achieving not only a similar performance to the benchmark but also outperforming it in some locations. It showed the most promising results in the middle level of aggregation. The result is a powerful and flexible approach that can be embedded in any decision support system.

Governments and health authorities have attempted to minimize this impact by enforcing different mandates. Recent studies have addressed the relationship between various socioeconomic variables and compliance level to these interventions. However, little attention has been paid to what constitutes people’s response and whether people behave differently when faced with different interventions. Data collected from different sources show very significant regional differences across the United States. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the fact that a response may be different depending on the health system capacity and each individuals’ social status. For that, we analyze the correlation between different societal (i.e., education, income levels, population density, etc.) and healthcare capacity-related variables (i.e., hospital occupancy rates, percentage of essential workers, etc.) in relation to people’s level of compliance with three main governmental mandates in the United States: mobility restrictions, mask adoption, and vaccine participation. Our aim was to isolate the most influential variables impacting behavior in response to these policies. We found that there was a significant relationship between individuals’ educational levels and political preferences with respect to compliance with each of these mandates.

To answer this question, in this paper we present a novel application of human mobility patterns and human behavior in a network setting. We analyze mobility data in New York City over two years, from January 2019 to December 2020, and create weekly mobility networks between Census Block Groups by aggregating Point of Interest level visit patterns. Our results suggest that both the socioeconomic and geographic attributes of neighborhoods significantly predict neighborhood adaptability to the shelter-in-place policies active at that time. That is, our findings and simulation results reveal that in addition to factors such as race, education, and income, geographical attributes such as access to amenities in a neighborhood that satisfy community needs were equally important factors for predicting neighborhood adaptability and the spread of COVID-19. The results of our study provide insights that can enhance urban planning strategies that contribute to pandemic alleviation efforts, which in turn may help urban areas become more resilient to exogenous shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

                            <p id="abstractText5" style="display: none;">The challenge of refugee relocation is fertile ground to pose a new direction in the quest for extended human intelligence: developing systems that leverage big data, and the power of social learning to provide personalized visual analytics for big life decisions. To probe into this new avenue, this paper presents Voyage Viewer, a novel open-access multi-stream data dashboard called Voyage Viewer. It helps individuals make their own relocation and migration decisions given personalized queries and visualizations, which stands in contrast to previous top-down approaches that use algorithms to match individuals and places, as is the case for some refugee relocation programs. Voyage Viewer hopes to foster social learning between community members to improve the match between migrants and their potential new communities so that both can reap the benefits of the move.

                            <p id="abstractText6" style="display: none;">Many studies propose methods for finding the best location for new stores and facilities, but few studies address the store closing problem. As a result of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many companies have been facing financial issues. In this situation, one of the most common solutions to prevent loss is to downsize by closing one or more chain stores. Such decisions are usually made based on single-store performance; therefore, the under-performing stores are subject to closures. This study first proposes a multiplicative variation of the well-known Huff gravity model and introduces a new attractiveness factor to the model. Then a forward–backward approach is used to train the model and predict customer response and revenue loss after the hypothetical closure of a particular store from a chain. In this research the department stores in New York City are studied using large-scale spatial, mobility, and spending datasets. The case study results suggest that the stores recommended being closed under the proposed model may not always match the single store performance, and emphasizes the fact that the performance of a chain is a result of interaction among the stores rather than a simple sum of their performance considered as isolated and independent units. The proposed approach provides managers and decision-makers with new insights into store closing decisions and will likely reduce revenue loss due to store closures.

Lockdown and travel restrictions imposed by local authorities have led to change in customer preferences and thus transformation of economic activity from traditional areas to new regions. While most changes have been temporary and short term, some of them have been observed to be of permanent nature. Using large-scale aggregated and anonymized transaction data across various socio-economic groups, we analyse and discuss such temporary relocation of citizens' economic activities in metropolitan areas of 15 states in the US. The results of this study have extensive implications for urban planners and business owners, and can provide insights into the temporary relocation of economic activities resulting from an extreme exogenous shock like the COVID-19 pandemic.

                            <p id="abstractText8" style="display: none;">Poor diets, including those high in fast food, are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Exposure to low-quality food environments, such as ‘food swamps’ saturated with fast food outlets (FFO), is hypothesized to negatively impact diet and related disease. However, research linking such exposure to diet and health outcomes has generated mixed findings and led to unsuccessful policy interventions. A major research limitation has been a predominant focus on static food environments around the home, such as food deserts and swamps, and sparse availability of information on mobile food environments people are exposed to and food outlets they visit as they move throughout the day. In this work, we leverage population-scale mobility data to examine peoples’ visits to food outlets and FFO in and beyond their home neighborhoods and to evaluate how food choice is influenced by features of food environments people are exposed to in their daily routines vs. individual preference. Using a semi-causal framework and various natural experiments, we find that 10% more FFO in an area increases the odds of people visiting a FFO by approximately 20%. This strong influence of the food environment happens similarly during weekends and weekdays, is largely independent of individual income. Using our results, we investigate multiple intervention strategies to food environments to promote reduced FFO visits. We find that optimal locations for intervention are a combination of where i) the prevalence of FFO is the highest, ii) most decisions about food outlet visits are made, and most importantly, iii) visitors’ food decisions are most susceptible to the environment. Multi-level interventions at the individual behavior- and food environment-level that target areas combining these features could have 1.7x to 4x larger effects than traditional interventions that alter food swamps or food deserts.

The stimulus checks were provided as part of the CARES Act aiming to provide emergency assistance for individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic. We analyze the impact of the receipt of those payments on the aggregated daily spending of different socio-economic groups and industries. We show that the transaction patterns of low spending consumers were most impacted by the stimulus payments among different spending groups. Our study results also indicate that the consumer responses after the first stimulus check (April 2020) were substantial and significant on industries that sell daily essential items, whereas consumer responses after the third stimulus check (March 2021) were significant in non-essential goods (e.g. luxury and entertainment sector). The results of this study are of crucial importance because they could help policy makers better shape stimulus payments that may be needed in future emergencies.
