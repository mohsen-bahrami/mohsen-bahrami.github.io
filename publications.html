A majority of such merchants rely on business financing, and thus, financial institutions and investors need to assess their performance before making decisions on business loans. However, current methods of predicting merchants’ future performance involve their private internal information, such as revenue and customer base, which cannot be shared without potentially exposing critical information. To address this problem, we first propose a novel approach to predicting merchants’ future performance using credit card transaction data. Specifically, we construct a merchant network, regarding customers as bridges between merchants, and extract features from the constructed network structure for prediction purposes. Our study results demonstrate that the performance of machine learning models with features extracted from our proposed network is comparable to those with conventional revenue- and customer-based features, while maintaining higher privacy levels when shared with third-party organizations. Our approach offers a practical solution to privacy concerns over data and information required for merchants’ performance prediction, enabling safe data-sharing among financial institutions and investors, helping them make more informed decisions on allocating their financial resources while ensuring that merchants’ sensitive information is kept confidential.

To make such predictions, sales time series or final customers’ data in geographical disaggregation are necessary. However, for most companies, such datasets are unavailable or impractical. The manuscript has two main goals. One focal problem is how to disaggregate an aggregate sales prediction with no historical proportions. The other is how to improve spatial models using Point of Interest (POI) data. To solve these problems, we combine two literature streams — spatial marketing and sales forecasting — and propose a new hybrid probabilistic approach: Gravitational Sales Prediction (GSP). Our approach uses POI data to estimate area attraction, customer stocks, and flows to predict sales proportions. We later use these proportions to disaggregate an aggregate forecast. GSP is validated using sales data from two countries and more than ten economic segments. When compared to a strong benchmark that relies on past sales proportions, GSP exceeded expectations by achieving not only a similar performance to the benchmark but also outperforming it in some locations. It showed the most promising results in the middle level of aggregation. The result is a powerful and flexible approach that can be embedded in any decision support system.

                            <p id="abstractText2" style="display: none;">Since its emergence, COVID-19 has caused a great impact in health and social terms. Governments and health authorities have attempted to minimize this impact by enforcing different mandates. Recent studies have addressed the relationship between various socioeconomic variables and compliance level to these interventions. However, little attention has been paid to what constitutes people’s response and whether people behave differently when faced with different interventions. Data collected from different sources show very significant regional differences across the United States. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the fact that a response may be different depending on the health system capacity and each individuals’ social status. For that, we analyze the correlation between different societal (i.e., education, income levels, population density, etc.) and healthcare capacity-related variables (i.e., hospital occupancy rates, percentage of essential workers, etc.) in relation to people’s level of compliance with three main governmental mandates in the United States: mobility restrictions, mask adoption, and vaccine participation. Our aim was to isolate the most influential variables impacting behavior in response to these policies. We found that there was a significant relationship between individuals’ educational levels and political preferences with respect to compliance with each of these mandates.
